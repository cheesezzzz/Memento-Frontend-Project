# Memento-Frontend-Project

So far this is one of the projects that I have spent a lot of time on by myself without following a video or copying code.

This landing page is basically a clone of Instrument.com but I tried to add more of a personal touch onto the website and made up a completely random studio called "Memento"

I experimented a lot with layouts, responsiveness, javascript functions (Intersection Observer API, toggling menu navigation with hamburger button, autoplay logo carousel)
